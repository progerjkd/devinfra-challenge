Hi Oliver,


My initial questions are above:

1) How is the process of visa sponsorship for the US? The succesful applicant will have a three year work permit and should return to his home country? It is based on the 'lotery system'?

2) How is going to be the interviewing tracking for that positions? One technical interview, home assessments with how many deadline days?
The assessments are more related with coding or with cloud, devops, automation, etc? I am studying hard those tools, mainly for my preparation for the Kubernetes Certified Administrator exam in the next weeks. So, it can be a kind of hard to study hard, as if applying for a Python Developer role. Recently have done some Python Restful API, with automated deployment on AWS, with concerning about scaling and downtime of that solution https://github.com/progerjkd/LambdaAPI . It's not a profile of a full python developer, but it is something that I am improving, and I'll get harder in the right time.

3) I'd like to let you know that I have a family with one 2 years old son. So what is the average salary that company is affordable to pay? 

4) I have send me three job descriptions, and indicated the Goldman Sachs one, you thing it is more suitable for my profile? Is that the position that you said that are a former Google SRE Manager?
